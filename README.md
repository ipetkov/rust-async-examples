## Parallel/Async Computations in Rust
This repo shows a few different ways of doing parallel/async computations in
Rust, with the use of several different community crates.

The test harness is pretty contrived, so don't expect to get any meaningful
comparisons of the performance of each method. However, the code samples
should be somewhat indicative of the different paradigms.

To see the examples in action, simply clone this repo, `cd` into the directory
and run `cargo run --release`!
